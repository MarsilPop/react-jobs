An SAP (Single Page Application) built in React that features a Job listing frontend website. 

The Home Page features a Hero Component, Navbar Component and boxes, this is where the fetched jobs appear. 

Read More takes the user to the Details Page with all the info about the jobs. 

There are buttons that Delete or Edit the job using Hooks.

The Add Page allows the user to Add a job by filling in a Form. 

The data is from a MOCK backend with JSON server which has CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality.

The design is done with Tailwind CSS by Traversy Media


                                                      -- DISCLAIMER --

The Jobs are not visible due to using a local server (JSON Server), more work is due regarding building an API with Express

The Project was made during a Course by Traversy Media React Course 2024

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
